                    I earned my Master of Music in French horn performance. played in professional orchestras and ensembles in Cleveland, Ohio. I taught myself to code and worked as a web developer for the awe-inspiring team at <a href="//whiteboard.is">Whiteboard</a>. I sing baritone in the <a href="//nashvillesymphony.org">Nashville Symphony Chorus</a> and in <a href="//operatn.org">Opera Tennessee</a> here in Chattanooga. And I decided to pursue my love for medicine and people by becoming a cardiac nurse here at <a href="//erlanger.org">Erlanger</a>.
